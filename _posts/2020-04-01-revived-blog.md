title: Revived the ol blog
---

[It's been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D-WVlRohQk) three years since I blogged. The old site was pretty messed up, Apache tried its best but blog.b303.me didn't work half the time and it interfered with my other sites somehow. Fortunately I'm now using nginx for all the things and much happier for it.

New domain, new name (I'm officially Alyssa Smith; oh yeah, I was a girl the whole time, that took a while to figure out), I don't have time to code much anymore (had a job from Nov 2017 to Nov 2019, been unemployed for six months, you'd really think I'd get back into coding in that time), hoping having this blog will inspire me to blow the dust off the ol 2010 macbook and write more cool shit. Which is a great reason to talk about the new macbook keyboards, as if that's still a topical thing to discuss.

As part of my last job, I got a 2017 macbook on salary sacrifice, and holy shit did it have the absolute worst keyboard I have ever used. Incredibly unsatisfying to type on. Almost glad I accidentally drowned it in Mother No Sugar after six months. I'd already moved everything off the 2010 macbook, and it's so slow I'm hesitant to go back to it, even if the keyboard is infinitely better.

Could always pack a desktop keyboard and mouse to use instead, but the trackpad on the macbooks is a really nice feature tbh. Ah well, can't have everything.
