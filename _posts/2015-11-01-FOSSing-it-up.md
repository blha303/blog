I'm now using Ubuntu on my desktop. I would be using i3, but some annoying
graphical glitches have pushed me back to Unity for the time being. It's not
too bad on a machine with a decent GPU, to be honest, the UX is just awful.
I'm installing Enlightenment now, always wanted to try it. I'm already using
Terminology, turns out it Just Works on Ubuntu :P

Might give ratpoison a try, I enjoyed using that on Arch when I tried that
a while back.
